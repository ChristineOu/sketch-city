## LAB 1: Introduction to Micro-controllers

### Objective
In this introductory lab, we learned how to use the various functionalities of the Arduino Uno and the Arduino IDE. Our team constructed a simple functional Arduino program using multiple external components and the Arduino Uno. Once we mastered this basic understanding, we put together our robot and had it perform a simple autonomous task like turning in nearly 90-degree angles and as an
extra credit, following a black-taped line using a Line Follower
Sensor.

### Materials
  * Arduino IDE Software
  * 1 Arduino Uno
  * 1 USB A/B cable
  * 1 Continuous rotation servo
  * 1 Pushbutton
  * 1 LED (we chose a blue LED)
  * 1 Potentiometer
  * Several resistors (300Ω and kΩ range)
  * 1 Solderless breadboard

### Blinking an internal LED
The “Blink” example code was used to test the communication between the Arduino Uno and the IDE. At first, the code was compiled and uploaded without any modifications, and the on-board LED blinked on and off according the a certain value of delay.

### Blinking an external LED

### Reading the value of a potentiometer

### Map the value of the potentiometer to the LED

### Map the value of the potentiometer to the servo

### Assemble your robot

### Driving your robot autonomously
