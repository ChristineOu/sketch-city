<h3 id="objective">Objective</h3>

<p>In this introductory lab, we learned how to use the various functionalities of the Arduino Uno and the Arduino IDE. Our team constructed a simple functional Arduino program using multiple external components and the Arduino Uno. Once we mastered this basic understanding, we put together our robot and had it perform a simple autonomous task like turning in nearly 90-degree angles and as an
extra credit, following a black-taped line using a Line Follower
Sensor.</p>

<h3 id="blinkinganinternalled">Blinking an internal LED</h3>

<p>The “Blink” example code was used to test the communication between the Arduino Uno and the IDE. At first, the code was compiled and uploaded without any modifications, and the on-board LED blinked on and off according to a certain value of delay.</p>

<p>To test the digital pins, an external blue LED was connected to digital <strong>pin 13</strong> in series with a 1k Ohm resistor. The external LED blinked on and off according to a certain value of delay.</p>

<h3 id="readingthevalueofapotentiometer">Reading the value of a potentiometer</h3>

<p>To test the analog input pins, a <strong>potentiometer</strong> was connected to analog input <strong>pin 0</strong> in series with a 1k Ohm resistor to input different voltages. For data analysis, we used enabled the serial monitor to display the analog value every half second.</p>

<h3 id="mapthevalueofthepotentiometertotheled">Map the value of the potentiometer to the LED</h3>

<p>Then the potentiometer was combined with the external LED circuit. The digital pin which the LED was connected to was set up as an PWM output pin. A square wave was generated to write analog voltages to the LED. This allowed the brightness of the LED to be adjusted with the potentiometer.</p>

<p>In the following image, the oscilloscope described a <em>Pulse Width Modulator (PWM)</em>, which is a very fast square wave with differing on and off times. Our team's pulse (time between ON and OFF) was about 18.5 ns:</p>

<h3 id="mapthevalueofthepotentiometertotheservo">Map the value of the potentiometer to the servo</h3>

<p>During this stage, the white input signal wire on the parallax servo was connected to pin 9 so that it can read analog output generated by the potentiometer. The red wire was connected to 5V, and black wire was connected to GND. Example code Servo Knob was used in this part. The potentiometer values are scaled between 0 to 180 corresponding to servo speed. Value 0 and 180 represent full speed in opposite directions and 90 represents stop.</p>

<p>We decided to go with bigger wheels in order to analyze how the robot behaves with such large tiles and the amount of speed it can reach.</p>

<h3 id="drivingyourrobotautonomously">Driving your robot autonomously</h3>

<p>As an extra-credit for Lab 1, our team included a Line Follower sensor that detected the existence of a black tape and knew the difference in color with respect to the white tiles on the floor. Using different sensors to manipulate the data acquired and programming our robot to react in a certain depending on the environment stimulation, is what actually makes it autonomous. On future labs, the team is planning on including different sensors like ultrasonic sensor for detecting the walls inside the maze, and maybe even position sensors to map the trajectory of the robot while solving the maze.</p>

<p>After seeing how the robot was behaving when approaching a tight curve like the one in the video, we realized that we were putting too much speed for the servo motors to achieve smooth left and right turns. Therefore, we lowered both servos' speeds and found a more efficient combination that definitely improved the robot's behavior.</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>

<p>The feedback we received from the robot's behavior has enabled our team to start thinking about how to build all the mechanical components, as well as how to write the motion algorithms based on sensor data analysis. We arrived to the conclusion that the servos can definitely behave strangely if not properly connected to power, contributing to an erroneous behavior from the robot. Also, with the inclusion of <strong>relatively large</strong> wheels, we confirmed that there is a serious tradeoff between speed and robustness. Even though we were one of the fastest teams in our lab session, we had to struggle and improvise a <em>sketchy</em> way of placing the sensor because of the ridiculous height of the robot.</p>
